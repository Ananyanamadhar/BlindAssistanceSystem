Real-time Object Detection with Audio Feedback using YOLOv8 (GPU Accelerated via CUDA)  This repository provides a Python application that leverages YOLOv8 for real-time object detection with a webcam. It offers audio feedback for detected objects, including basic directional guidance, and supports GPU acceleration (CUDA) for faster processing.
